     <p> When I'm not coding, I'm exploring the great outdoors. 
      Trekking and mountaineering are my passions, offering a fresh perspective and the thrill of overcoming new challengesâ€”parallels to the problem-solving I love in software development.

     <p> Gadgets are another interest of mine, merging my enthusiasm for cutting-edge technology with the joy of adventure.
       Whether it's navigating rugged trails or cruising through city streets, I embrace the blend of innovation and excitement.

     <p>  There's nothing quite like the tranquility of watching a sunrise or sunset. 
      These moments of peace and reflection recharge my spirit, fueling my creativity and drive for my next tech project.
